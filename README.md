## Neutrino Induced Charm Production Studies in SHiP Experiment @ CERN SPS

This repository includes some part of my analysis files. I will try to keep all the files up-to-date and make it public. Until that time, I just use Github to track my changes and learn Github.

At first look, the code can looks like a trash, but it works anyway! I'll also try to rewrite it in a more elegant form..
